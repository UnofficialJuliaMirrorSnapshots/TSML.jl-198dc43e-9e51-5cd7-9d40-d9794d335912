# Statistical Metrics

Each TS can be evaluated to extract its statistical features which can be used for
data quality assessment, data discovery by clustering and classification, and anomaly
characterization among others.

TSML relies on `Statifier` to perform statistical metrics on the TS which can be
configured to extract the statistics of missing blocks aside from the non-missing elements.
Some of the scalar statistics it uses include: pacf, acf, autocor, quartiles, mean, median,
max, min, kurtosis, skewness, variation, standard error, entropy, etc. It has only
one argument `:processmissing => true` which indicates whether to include the statistics of
missing data.

Let us again start generating an artificial data with missing values 
using the `generateDataWithMissing()` described in the beginning of tutorial.

```@setup stat
using Random, Dates, DataFrames
function generateDataWithMissing()
   Random.seed!(123)
   gdate = DateTime(2014,1,1):Dates.Minute(15):DateTime(2016,1,1)
   gval = Array{Union{Missing,Float64}}(rand(length(gdate)))
   gmissing = 50000
   gndxmissing = Random.shuffle(1:length(gdate))[1:gmissing]
   df = DataFrame(Date=gdate,Value=gval)
   df[:Value][gndxmissing] .= missing
   return df
end
```
```@example stat
X = generateDataWithMissing()
first(X,15)
```

## Statifier for Both Non-Missing and Missing Values

TSML includes `Statifier` transformer that computes scalar statistics to
characterize the time series data. By default, it also computes statistics of 
missing blocks of data. To disable this feature, one can pass 
`:processmissing => false` to the argument during its instance creation. Below
illustrates this workflow.

```@example stat
using Dates
using TSML
using TSML.TSMLTypes
using TSML.TSMLTransformers
using TSML: Pipeline
using TSML: DateValgator
using TSML: DateValNNer
using TSML: Statifier

dtvalgator = DateValgator(Dict(:dateinterval => Dates.Hour(1)))
dtvalnner = DateValNNer(Dict(:dateinterval => Dates.Hour(1)))
dtvalizer = DateValizer(Dict(:dateinterval => Dates.Hour(1)))
stfier = Statifier(Dict(:processmissing => true))

mypipeline = Pipeline(
  Dict( :transformers => [
            dtvalgator,
            stfier
         ]
  )
)

fit!(mypipeline,X)
results = transform!(mypipeline,X)
```

## Statifier for Non-Missing Values only

If you are not intested with the statistics of the missing blocks, you can disable missing
blocks stat summary by indicating `:processmissing => false` in the instance argument:

```@example stat
stfier = Statifier(Dict(:processmissing=>false))
mypipeline = Pipeline(
  Dict( :transformers => [
            dtvalgator,
            stfier
         ]
  )
)
fit!(mypipeline,X)
results = transform!(mypipeline,X)
```

## Statifier After Imputation

Let us check the statistics after the imputation by adding `DateValNNer` instance in the
pipeline. We expect that if the imputation is successful,
the stats for missing blocks will all be NaN because stats of empty set is an NaN.

```@example stat
stfier = Statifier(Dict(:processmissing=>true))
mypipeline = Pipeline(
  Dict( :transformers => [
            dtvalgator,
            dtvalnner,
            stfier
         ]
  )
)
fit!(mypipeline,X)
results = transform!(mypipeline,X)
```

As we expected, the imputation is successful and there are no more missing values in the
processed time series dataset.

Let's try with the other imputation using `DateValizer` and validate that there are no more
missing values based on the stats.

```@example stat
stfier = Statifier(Dict(:processmissing=>true))
mypipeline = Pipeline(
  Dict( :transformers => [
            dtvalgator,
            dtvalizer,
            stfier
         ]
  )
)
fit!(mypipeline,X)
results = transform!(mypipeline,X)
```

Indeed, the imputation got rid of the missing values.
