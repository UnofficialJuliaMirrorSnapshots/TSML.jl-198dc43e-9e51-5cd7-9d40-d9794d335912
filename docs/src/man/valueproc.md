# [Value Preprocessing](@id valueprep)
In order to process 1-D TS as input for ML model, it has to
be converted into Matrix form where each row represents a 
slice of 1-D TS representing daily/hourly/weekly pattern
depending on the size of the chunk, stride, and 
number of steps ahead for prediction. Below illustrates
the processing workflow to `Matrify` a 1-D TS.

For illustration purposes, the code below generates a 
Date,Value dataframe where the values are just a sequece
of integer from 1 to the length of the date sequence.
We use this simple sequence to have a better understanding how the
slicing of rows, steps ahead, and the stride to create the `Matrified` output
is generated.


```@example matrify
using TSML

lower = DateTime(2017,1,1)
upper = DateTime(2017,1,5)
dat=lower:Dates.Hour(1):upper |> collect
vals = 1:length(dat)
x = DataFrame(Date=dat,Value=vals)
nothing #hide
```

```@repl matrify
last(x,5)
```

## Matrifier
Let us create an instance of Matrifier passing the size of row,
stride, and steps ahead to predict:

```@example matrify
mtr = Matrifier(Dict(:ahead=>6,:size=>6,:stride=>3))
fit!(mtr,x)
res = transform!(mtr,x)
nothing #hide
```

```@repl matrify
first(res,5)
```

In this example, we have hourly values. We indicated in the 
`Matrifier` to generate a matrix where the size of each row
is 6 hours, steps ahead for prediction is 6 hours and the
stride of 3 hours. There are 7 columns because the last column
indicates the value indicated by the steps `ahead` argument.

Let us try to make a matrix with the size of 6 hours, steps ahead of
2 hours, and a stride of 3 hours:

```@example matrify
mtr = Matrifier(Dict(:ahead=>2,:size=>6,:stride=>3))
fit!(mtr,x)
res = transform!(mtr,x)
nothing #hide
```

```@repl matrify
first(res,5)
```
